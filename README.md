Project Overview: Enhancing the Prusa MK3 Extruder with Geared Design

This project is converting the Prusa MK3 extruder into a geared extruder configuration. The primary goal is to harness the advantages of a geared extruder while retaining compatibility with as many of the original stock components as feasible. 

Some new parts are required:
1) Bontech RIDGA V2 https://www.bondtech.se/product/oem-ridga-reverse-integrated-drive-gear-assembly-v2/
2) LDO-36STH20-1004AHG (XH)
3) 1 off M3x10 Cap head screw
4) 1 off M3 Nyloc nut
5) Printed parts in the files section

Notes on printed parts:
Materials that have been tested so far: PETG
Some of the components do have overhangs and need supports
When printing the parts in PETG I use PLA as a support interface with:
Top Z distance = 0mm
Top interface spacing = 0mm
This gives a good quality finish on the overhanging surfaces

Assembly Guide:
Update required - The step file shows the orientation and alignment of the new components. Otherwise the assembly steps are very similar to the stock extruder
